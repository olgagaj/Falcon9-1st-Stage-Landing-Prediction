# In this project, I will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
The project is a part of Applied Data Science Capstone.
